"statisticsMU123.py" is the main file that contains the class Dataset used to create objects from datasets, and rounding() function, which was created for precision rounding.

The objects will be initialized with the attributes of mean, median, range, Q1, Q3 and IQR.

"statisticsFromTXT.py" is a simple program designed to test the above program by using data from .txt files.

I had this idea from using Dotplotter, I found interesting the idea of creating a program that would give me the exact same information.

The next updates will add the Standard Deviation and also rounding to 2 d.p.
