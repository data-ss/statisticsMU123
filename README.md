"statisticsMU123.py" is the main file that contains the class Dataset, useful to create objects from datasets.
These objects will be initialized with the attributes of mean, median, range, Q1, Q3 and IQR.

I had this idea from using Dotplotter, I found interesting the idea of creating a program that would give me the exact same information.

The next updates will add the Standard Deviation and also rounding to 2 d.p.
